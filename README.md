**A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server. Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you.**

**show remote reps we have**
```
git remote -v
```
**you should at least see origin — that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from**

**this command add a remote rep and we can exchange data with it. when you clone sth you added a remote rep nmaed origin**
```
git remote add [name] [url link]
```
